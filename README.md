# CLI-Solitaire

A simple solitaire game written in C++ that can be played in the terminal.

Seeing how trash people were in making a simple terminal game as an COMP assignment even when in groups of 5, 
I decided to try making one by myself.

This is one of the easier games to implement, no idea why they did not go forward with the idea.
